# at-helper

Open source implementation of the ATLauncher server compilation process. Tell it a pack to make, and it'll create one for you.

> Disclaimer: ATLauncher does not host these pack publicly for a reason: many authors do not allow 3rd party distribution of their mods. Likewise, packs compiled with the at-helper should not be redistributed. This is for private use only.
